# Protein Tertiary Structure Prediction
This project aims at reproducing selected part of Mohammed AlQuraishi's work on End-to-end differentiable learning of protein structure (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/08/29/265231), and Gao et al. on RaptorX (https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-018-2065-x).
